# I2C Slave on STM32F401CCU6

### What this project is
This project was created to learn basic principles, logic and how I2C protocol works.
Learn how to design and develop I2C driver and custom HAL-like library. This project aims to study the slave device.
This project is developed accordingly to online course [(MCU1) Learn bare-metal driver development using Embedded C:
Writing drivers for STM32 GPIO, I2C, SPI, USART from scratch.](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/)

### Goals
- learn the I2C protocol general principles, architecture and registers
- learn how to design and develop I2C driver and library
- learn how to calculate the correct circuit parameters (resistance, voltage, etc.) for I2C communication
- learn how to build slave-device logic for I2C
- learn both blocking and non-blocking (with interrupts) communication
- learn how to check I2C communication with logic analyzer

### What actually program does
- configure all required peripherals for button, LED, I2C
- configure the I2C port parameters and behavior
- configure interruption setups
- design event callback API
- receive data from master and send the response accordingly to the AppEvCallback logic

### How to check I2C communication with Sealae Logic Analyzer
- connect master-device, slave device and logic analyzer together (I've used breadboard for convenience)
- add external pull-up resistors 4.7 kΩ
- configure PulseView measure parameters (I've used 16 MHz and 50-100 MS/s)
- check the transmitted and received signals
